# comet-holmes
A project &amp; paper where we rediscover the orbit of Comet Holmes by searching the web for images

This was published in the Astronomical Journal (Lang &amp; Hogg 2012; AJ 144, 46), and is available on the Arxiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.6038 .

NOTE that the image dataset is provided in the data/2010-04-16-holmes-dedup directory, but we do NOT have permission from the copyright owners to distribute these images.  For all the images that appear in the paper, we did (painstakingly) contact each image owner and received permission.  (The owner of the kitten picture was particularly pleased.)
